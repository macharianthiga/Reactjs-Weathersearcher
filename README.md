This application is available at https://sheltered-sands-28390.herokuapp.com/

 A simple Reactjs application that uses the OpenWeatherMap Api to fetch the weather of any city or town in the world.

I built this application mostly for fun and also to add to my Github which I rarely update and which was lacking any tangible React projects. Hope you find intuitive and fun to use. Feel free to contact me for projects on dmdmasha28@gmail.com

Here are some of the tools I used:

React - This was the Javascript framework I used.
Open Weather Map API - I used the Open Weather Map API to search for weather data by city
